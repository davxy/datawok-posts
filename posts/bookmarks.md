  Cryptologic Research (IACR).

### Challenges

- [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org) -  A fun platform for learning
  cryptography. The emphasis is on breaking bad implementations of "modern"
  crypto, such as AES, RSA, and Elliptic-curve. The format is a series of
  puzzles that teach small lessons and motivate further research.

- [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com) - Problems to solve derived from
  weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions.
  When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how
  cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.

- [ID0-RSA](https://id0-rsa.pub) - Problems related to computer security.
