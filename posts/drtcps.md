A glimpse to the world of Cyber Physical Systems that are changing the world as
we know.

From the isolated Monolithic Systems to the conception of **System of Systems**
that are able to interact with the surrounding physical world.

Interfaces between distributed systems and **Emergent** behaviors of distributed
systems of systems.

**Time and Clock** considerations and the need of a global timebase for
distributed coordination.

Failures and **Failure Detection**.

Distributed **Consensus** issue and possible solutions in **asynchronous
systems**.

Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Bizantine Fault Tolerance in the **Blockchain**.

Introduction to **Real Time** Systems.

**The work was deeply inspired by the work of Prof. Andrea Bondavalli, Full
Professor at DSI and Head of Resilient Computing Lab Group.**
